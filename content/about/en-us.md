My professional history started in 2008 as an intern at the institution where I graduated in Software Development and
where I had my first opportunities to solve problems by programming.

I entered the industry in 2011 and, until 2015, I basically developed websites, content manager systems, corporate
intranet systems and e-commerces. It was a learning period when I had much contact with more experienced professionals
who helped me a lot.

In 2016 I started working on more complex projects, especially on the back end, but on the front end as well. Since
then, I have been developing a lot of APIs, integrations between systems in different ways, asynchronous processes,
routines and so on. Also, things like code review, automated tests and clean code have made part of my routine.

Since 2017 I have been working remotely. It was not easy at the beginning, but after some studies, I learned how to make
it work which has improved my quality of life.

Some time later I started having my first experiences as a Tech Lead which made me become a person who is always trying
to help the team to achieve goals.
