A few days ago, I mentioned in a post that many people came to me and asked which college they needed to go to start
programming. As I think about how this question has an obvious answer for me, I remember how, thirteen years ago, I was
even more lost than these people.

If you're in a hurry and came to this post looking for a quick answer, I'll give you my opinion on the subject: **it's
not worth going to college for programming**.

**That simple?**

No. There are a series of factors to be evaluated such as course quality, level of knowledge or personal desire, for
example.

Yes. When we think on the pros and cons, the second one always wins. Ironically this becomes clearer after you graduate.

### My evaluation criteria

**The dynamics of the profession**

Programming is an extremely technical and practical activity. It's like in the mechanic profession, it doesn't matter if
you read fifty books on the subject, that doesn't make you a professional. Theory needs to be applied to transform it
into actual knowledge.

**Useless content in courses**

During my undergraduate studies, I took classes on administration, accounting, Portuguese, English, law, among others. A
gigantic amount of hours dedicated to subjects that served no purpose. From what I've seen from other colleges, it's
very common for these subjects to be present in the curriculum just to increase the workload.

**The price**

It is not difficult to find a degree that costs a considerable amount of money per month/year. The amount of content
that it is possible to access using half of that and without leaving home is immeasurable.

You can make much smaller investments to learn more specific things. Not to mention the amount of free, quality content
available on the internet.

**The time**

Image you spending 3,200 hours, sitting in a chair in a classroom. This is an approximate number of hours of a higher
education course in the technology area. Now, imagine using this time to study only what you want to focus on, like
developing applications, for example. A little imagination is enough to understand the obvious, isn’t it?

**The diploma doesn't matter much**

In many areas, such as medicine, it is unthinkable for a professional to work without a degree. In programming, this
definitely doesn't happen.

Even if you have a nice diploma hanging on the wall, without practical experience, it is very likely that you will lose
a position to another professional who has been working in the field for a few months and only has a high school
diploma. The important thing is what you know in practice, the problems you have already solved, the projects you have
already participated in.

### Don't you get anything out of college?

It's not quite like that. There are a series of concepts that we work on in programming that are learned in
undergraduate courses, especially for those who are starting - practically - from scratch. Algorithms, data structure,
object orientation, systems architecture, standards.

On the other hand, it is essential that these teachings are put into practice during the course. Otherwise, very little
will be used. It is also important to say that it is completely possible to learn them in another way.

### My experience

I already wrote here on the blog
about [my first experiences in programming](/blog/posts/my-first-experiences-as-a-developer).

Contrary to my opinion, I took two courses: technician and technologist. 13 years ago, we still didn't have so much
access to information and the truth is that I didn't even know what a programmer did, much less how to become one.

Even though I studied, I tried to put it into practice very early on and that was what really made the difference.

I was able to interact with a few dozen professionals in my field and, whenever we brought up the subject, we reached
the same conclusion most of the time. Many abandoned their courses halfway through, because after some time in the
market it no longer made sense to spend time and money on it.

### Then

If your dream is to go to college, really do it! My intention with this text is not to demotivate anyone, it is to make
them understand that they don't need it and that it's just not worth it.

The most important thing is that you put into practice what you study. Start a project of your own, about anything and
simply write. With each challenge you encounter, new lessons will be learned. This is how we still learn today.

My final tip is to read the post where I talk about
the [simplest and cheapest way to start a career as a developer](/blog/posts/the-simplest-and-cheapest-way-to-start-a-developer-career).
It would be a great starting point.
