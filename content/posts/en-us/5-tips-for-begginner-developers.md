It doesn't matter who you are, the technology you use, whether you're in a big or small company, every programmer has
had the experience of being a beginner, of not really knowing what you're doing and having that feeling of being
completely lost.

If this is your moment, we are talking about one of the most important phases of your programming journey. The phase of
many discoveries, many learnings, but also many doubts.

Even though it's been a good few years now, I remember that my beginnings weren't much different from that. In the teams
I led, I noticed very similar behaviors and difficulties. Based on this, I will share below some tips that I think are
important.

### Take it easy on the concepts

Programming is nothing more than an abstraction of a series of logical and mathematical theories. Understanding its
concepts is one of the most important steps towards becoming a programmer capable of solving big problems. This is a
fact!

On the other hand, you need to be a little careful with this. I recommend that you try to limit the amount of content
you study at the same time. Try to advance the theory as you put it into practice and don't waste time on things that
are outside your current context.

In the beginning, it is very common that, with each search for knowledge, you find even more doubts than before. In
other words, the more you study, the more you will study. This alone can be enough to cause information overload.

Basically, who will tell you what you need to learn will be the problems you have to solve.

### Take it easy on the hype

We live in the most dynamic time in the history of our area. New technologies, frameworks and services are being
launched all the time. Many of these “news” end up spreading very quickly, giving the impression that it is something
that will take over the market and that everything else will disappear.

The truth is that things don't change that quickly. The most important thing now is to complete the ongoing project with
the technology you already use.

I'm not saying not to update yourself, much less not to pay attention to what's new on the market, on the contrary, it's
part of the profession to stay up to date. Just do it prudently.

### Do not ignore good practices

At the beginning of my career, it was common for me to have to maintain a system and simply not understand the code I
had written. The reasons were simple: functions with excessive logic and bad naming.

In fact, that's not your focus right now. The most important thing is your progress. On the other hand, well-written
code will help you understand things better and, consequently, evolve. Write small functions with clear names, take the
same care with variable naming. This will help a lot when reading the code later.

### You don't need to know things by heart

In the beginning, it is very common for us to worry too much about knowing how each thing should be done, or even how
the languages' native functions behave.

This should definitely not be a concern. Myself, I'm always researching basic functionalities of the technologies I use
because I simply don't remember. The most important thing in a programmer's career at any level is knowing WHERE and HOW
to find what they need.

You can also use some comments in the code to guide you, but I recommend that you do this very early on and consider
abandoning this practice whenever possible. I wrote more about this subject in the
post [5 thoughts on comments in code](/blog/posts/5-thoughts-on-comments-in-code).

### Listen to your more experienced mates, but be careful

One of the truths of my career is that I would never be at the level I am today if I hadn't worked with the
professionals I worked with. Having people around you who know more than you is really something special.

If you have a technical leader, work the way he is asking. The teachings of someone more experienced, added to your
practice, will create your own way of working, which will mature over time.

Just be careful with a single opinion source. If you don't have another professional to ask, search Google for other
opinions and bring them up for discussion. There are a lot of high-ego programmers out there, pulling the “sardines” to
their own side.

### Then

Be patient and let things happen in their own time. This is definitely not a simple journey and, with current resources,
your evolution tends to take much less time than you think.

Hope this helps. See you later!
