Lately, many people have come to me with the following questions: what college do I have to go to? Is this course good?
where do I start? Is it very difficult to do what you do?

In fact, this was one of the reasons why I decided to start a blog and, obviously, this post here.

The truth is that there is no correct way or the one that works best. It is possible to start with traditional training
courses or completely from scratch, without ever entering a classroom.

If you have the desire or the ability to go to college, nothing against it. Now, this will not be decisive in making you
a high-level professional in the field.

### Which path did I follow?

**In this order:**

- Techncal course;
- Degree and internship, simultaneously;
- First jog;

### So am I contradicting myself?

Yes and no. I took the path considered traditional, it's true, but we're talking about thirteen years ago. Currently,
the people are infinitely more familiar with technology and computers have become true home appliances.

If I tell you that I saw a friend who worked as an agricultural technician become a senior developer without taking a
course even?

Yes, and he followed the path I suggest below.

### Start by frontend

**But, what is frontend?**

Basically, it involves the visual programming of a website or web system.

When you access a website, everything you see is nothing more than code that has been interpreted by the browser. The
colors, the size of the elements, the images, the links. Somehow it all went through a developer and is part of what we
call frontend.

The code is divided into two languages:
**HTML** - structuring: this is what I use to define what should appear on the screen, such as: a button.
**CSS** - styling: this is what I use to define how the structure should appear on the screen, such as: the color of the
button.

There is a third, but it is not essential for the moment.

### In practice

The image below is a screenshot of my browser displaying an example page. In it we have text with a link in the middle
and a button below.

Now, see below the code I made to develop a screen like this. I'm not going to explain everything, otherwise it would be
a very long post.

```html

<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Start from scratch!</title>

    <style>
        body {
            background-color: beige;
            text-align: center;
            font-size: 20px;
        }

        p {
            margin-top: 50px;
        }

        a.link {
            color: orangered;
        }

        button {
            color: white;
            border: none;
            padding: 10px;
            background: red;
            border-radius: 5px;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    That is how you start a paragraph. <br><br>
    You can also use a <a class="link" href="https://thiagoalves.dev">link</a> in order to access the home page.
    <br><br>
    Or use the button below to get this over!
</p>
<button>Explode the screen!</button>
</body>
</html>
```

Analyze the code and write in the comments if you understood it or if you have any questions.

I just used a simple text editor like notepad and browser to do this. Of course, knowledge too.

### Is that only it?

No. Obviously, the more complex the screen you need to develop, the more work you will have.

But understand, we are talking about a journey and you are starting from scratch. If you learn to do something new every
day, it won't be long before you can develop your first website on your own.

The more you learn, the greater your ability to learn more. Over time, this becomes a common part of your routine.

### Final thoughts

The frontend market is one of the largest in the world. It is possible to start from the basics, as demonstrated here,
to the development of very elaborate systems and applications.

I consider it the perfect gateway. A much more intuitive and visual part of programming. It makes learning much easier.

It's just a matter of time to get into more complex activities.

See you later!
