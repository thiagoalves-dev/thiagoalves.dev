I've been struggling with this damn error for four hours now. Why did I have to say this task was simple!? Dude, but the
code is right, this error doesn't make sense. Putz! I needed to restart the service. It worked!

\- Thiago, error in production, customer saying he can't change the password.

I wonder: what kind of person bothers changing their shopping website password on Friday at 5pm?

It's working for me! I'll have to access the logs to see what happened. There is nothing there. That's weird! It looks
like it's not loading. Internet dropped.

\- The client sent a print via chat, I'll send it to you.

I program in PHP, but I want to learn Python. Python nothing, everyone is using Javascript, it's the future. Should I
start with Angular, Vue or React? Angular is from Google, React from Facebook. Vue is easier. I give up, I'm going to
learn Java and create a native application for Andoird, but now this is done with Kotlin. Damn, PHP 8 is coming out!

\- So, to do this, you need to trigger an event and create a Listener that will place a Job in the Redis queue.

I understood! But what Listener? And Job? And this Redis guy?

Man, how I hate working with templates. What a boring task.

The bad thing about working with products is that it seems like we always do the same thing, there isn't that diversity
of tasks. On the other hand, I don't like jumping from project to project, the code becomes a mess because there isn't
time to do things the best way.

\- Did you see that there is a vacancy paying a lot of money for a COBOL programmers?

I need to refactor this here. This class depends on this one here, which depends on that one there. I think if I touch
this now I will waste a lot of time. Today I would do this role in a completely different way. I'll refactor.

Slack notification. I'm not going to see that now, I need to finish this task soon.

Phone rings.

\- Thiago, you can look at slack, I need help solving a problem here.

OK.

\- I think I got it, I don't need it anymore.

I should do something else with my life, try a less stressful profession where I don't have to stay in front of the
computer all day, talk to people. Although I don't like people that much and here I can do my work quietly listening to
music.

\- Wow, it's already late!

I finally managed to finish this task, I can't believe it, I spent too much time on it. I knew I had forgotten
something, I haven't written the tests yet. Well they say to do that first. I need a coffee. Coffee is over.
