# Thiagoalves.dev

This is my professional [website](https://thiagoalves.dev) which I use to share my experiences and who I am.

## Dependencies

The project was developed with [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), but only
Docker is necessary to set it up.

**More details:**

- Docker >= 20;
- Docker-compose >= 1.29;

## Setup

After cloning the repository, execute the following command and wait for build process:

 ```shell script
$ docker-compose up
```

It might take a some minutes in the first time because of the Docker containers, but it is much faster later.

When the build ends, the following URL is showed: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Also, browsersync is already configured.
